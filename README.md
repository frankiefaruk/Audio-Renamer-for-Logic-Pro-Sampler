# Tkinter-Based Audio File Renamer and Text File Generator

## Overview

This Python script provides a simple GUI tool for renaming audio files and generating a text file listing. Built using Tkinter, it allows users to set a naming convention for audio files and create a text document listing the filenames in the specified format.

## Features

- **File Renaming**: Rename multiple audio files at once, based on a user-defined naming convention. This helps organize audio files systematically for easier access and sampling.
- **Text File Generation**: Create a text file listing each renamed audio file for record-keeping or other reference needs.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter**: Comes pre-installed with Python on most platforms.
- **OS Module**: Used for renaming files, also pre-installed with Python.

## Installation

No specific installation is required beyond Python and Tkinter, as these modules come standard with most Python distributions.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**: Start the script by running `python your_script_name.py`.
2. **Select Files**: Click on "Select Files" to open a file selection dialog and choose the audio files you want to rename.
3. **Enter Details**: Enter the new name, expression/technique, and group name in the provided fields.
4. **Rename Files**: Click "Rename Files" to rename all selected files according to the entered format.
5. **Generate Text File**: Click "Generate Text File" to create a `.txt` file listing each renamed audio file.

## Example Output Format

- **Renamed File**: `0_NewName_Expression_Group.wav`
- **Text File Entry**: `0_NewName_Expression_Group.wav`

## Customization

You can modify the file naming format in the `rename_files` function, or adjust the text file output by editing the `create_text_file` function.
